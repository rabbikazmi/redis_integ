ROLE: The "Blueprint" (BaseDB Interface).

DESCRIPTION:
This file defines the 'Rules' for how any database in our system must behave. 
By creating this 'Abstract Base Class' (ABC), we ensure that whether we are 
using JSON files or a Pro-level database like Redis, they all use the same 
commands (get, set, delete).

This makes the rest of the app much easier to write because it doesn't have 
to care HOW the data is stored, only that it CAN be stored.
